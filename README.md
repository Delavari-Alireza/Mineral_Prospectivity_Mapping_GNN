# Mineral_Prospectivity_Mapping_GNN
This repository contains Python implementations of advanced graph neural network (GAT and GCN) models applied for Mineral Prospectivity Mapping (MPM). The primary goal is to predict and identify potential mineral deposit locations using graph neural network techniques.
